411,QUESTION: yeah yeah i see what you mean sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [SEP] ANSWER: uh pardon you said you put your fish,0
411,QUESTION: what do you do when you are annoyed [SEP] ANSWER: what do i do when i'm annoyed,0
411,QUESTION: yes [SEP] ANSWER: um <sigh> <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um i guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy,0
411,QUESTION: how hard is that [SEP] ANSWER: um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're put in other situations where you're forced to to um understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is,0
411,QUESTION: yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [SEP] ANSWER: <sigh> let me think um <tisk> uh <sigh> last time i argued about something um god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something,0
411,QUESTION: can you tell me about that [SEP] ANSWER: um uh <sigh> oh i know what it was um it was somebody who belonged to the uh uh scientology faith um i uh inherited i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and um uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive and um <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited and um and he said something about are you aware of past lives and i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them,0
411,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: and i and he said that are you aware that um <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness um resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge i take sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would fold down i had my boo boo and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child,0
411,QUESTION: right [SEP] ANSWER: and i would actually even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh um uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has,0
411,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: you know so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated,0
411,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery,0
411,QUESTION: i understand [SEP] ANSWER: uh the following week and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that past lives can also affect you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so but um <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>,0
411,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: but other than that i mean i don't,0
411,QUESTION: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [SEP] ANSWER: <sigh> um uh <sigh> sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when when it's in terms of patience,0

449,QUESTION: mhm how are you at controlling your temper [SEP] ANSWER: i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with um i don't really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there,0
449,QUESTION: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [SEP] ANSWER: actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings,0
449,QUESTION: how did you feel in that moment [SEP] ANSWER: when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard,0
449,QUESTION: mm tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [SEP] ANSWER: hmm <sigh> let's see i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting him to call me and i think it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kinda you know i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense,0
449,QUESTION: uh huh do you find it easy to be a parent [SEP] ANSWER: woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect,0
449,QUESTION: that's good what's the hardest thing about being a parent [SEP] ANSWER: seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me,0
449,QUESTION: yeah what's the best thing about being a parent [SEP] ANSWER: it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that,0
449,QUESTION: what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents [SEP] ANSWER: wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent,0
449,QUESTION: tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [SEP] ANSWER: divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about,0
449,QUESTION: what made you decide to do that [SEP] ANSWER: uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return,0
449,QUESTION: okay [SEP] ANSWER: <laughter>,0
449,QUESTION: how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [SEP] ANSWER: you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day,0
449,QUESTION: that's good how have you been feeling lately [SEP] ANSWER: really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not,0

477,QUESTION: okay who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [SEP] ANSWER: um i'd say well um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences scrubbed_entry when i came out to california um i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and um we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice,0

477,QUESTION: uh huh what are you like when you don't sleep well [SEP] ANSWER: um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel i'll take the red-eye um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i um sleep poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay but usually the second day is not very good um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate and um i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle,0
477,QUESTION: okay how have you been feeling lately [SEP] ANSWER: i would say good um summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good,0

477,QUESTION: yeah i see what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [SEP] ANSWER: <laughter> so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is um when you think about buying something instead of thinking uh oh here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago,0
477,QUESTION: hmm what are you most proud of in your life [SEP] ANSWER: <sigh> probably scrubbed_entry um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so,0

438,QUESTION: tell me about your kids [SEP] ANSWER: um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty um they're teenage years um my youngest um still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well,0
438,QUESTION: what's the best thing about being a parent [SEP] ANSWER: just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and um the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back,0
438,QUESTION: aw that's so good to hear what's the hardest thing about being a parent [SEP] ANSWER: um mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is um the financial um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing um you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with,0
438,QUESTION: yeah how do you cope with them [SEP] ANSWER: well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate um if i see i need a little help if if you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably,0

364,QUESTION: okay sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax [SEP] ANSWER: oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter> but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but,0
364,QUESTION: that's great [SEP] ANSWER: yes that was uh that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better uh at the,0

364,QUESTION: how are you at controlling your temper [SEP] ANSWER: i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i might've said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties,0
364,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity,0
364,QUESTION: when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [SEP] ANSWER: oh wow you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads so,0
364,QUESTION: how did you feel in that moment [SEP] ANSWER: i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have but you're not really thinking of that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know i'm pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match,0
364,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us,0
364,QUESTION: mhm tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [SEP] ANSWER: hm there's one recently my father passed away uh recently,0
364,QUESTION: i'm sorry [SEP] ANSWER: thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time's passed i wish i'd invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so,0
364,QUESTION: i see tell me about your relationship with your family [SEP] ANSWER: um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess we're also uh different,0

364,QUESTION: do you feel like therapy is useful [SEP] ANSWER: i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it,0
364,QUESTION: what got you to seek help [SEP] ANSWER: oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger,0

364,QUESTION: how has seeing a therapist affected you [SEP] ANSWER: i think it's nice you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity,0
364,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man,0
364,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: so but it's um i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good,0

314,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been,0
314,QUESTION: how hard is that [SEP] ANSWER: um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like,0

314,QUESTION: that sounds like a great situation [SEP] ANSWER: and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences,0
314,QUESTION: mhm is there anything you regret [SEP] ANSWER: um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny,0

314,QUESTION: what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [SEP] ANSWER: now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things,0

367,QUESTION: how did you feel in that moment [SEP] ANSWER: in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now,1
367,QUESTION: yeah what got you to seek help [SEP] ANSWER: um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough,1

380,QUESTION: when was the last time that happened [SEP] ANSWER: what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate,1
380,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: hmm the last time i had a heated debate was um i had a heated debate about uh the movie boogie nights um i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie,1
380,QUESTION: why yes [SEP] ANSWER: um they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um they have a certain uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like <sigh> um what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx it's like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot um kind of like uh yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's the um i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like,1
380,QUESTION: mm [SEP] ANSWER: in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool um the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained,1
380,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is,1
380,QUESTION: right [SEP] ANSWER: and um and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera and um and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else,1
380,QUESTION: hmm [SEP] ANSWER: um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like um like who uh like she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor,1
380,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate um and uh somewhat like yeah and it's it uh so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um i think of losing my temper as being more um like i just so <s> i i would so <s> revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but i i didn't like that's not um maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort,1

439,QUESTION: tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [SEP] ANSWER: um i retired early um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long um i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i don't i pay very little money so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive,0

439,QUESTION: that sounds really hard [SEP] ANSWER: yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um what do you call the um barrel insurance we had that and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on,0

373,QUESTION: what are some things you don't really like about l_a [SEP] ANSWER: uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston so uh it's not the worst but um uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but i can't really change geography,0

373,QUESTION: what do you enjoy about traveling [SEP] ANSWER: uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created,0
373,QUESTION: mhm i'd love to hear about one of your trips [SEP] ANSWER: uh yeah sure i went to uh barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world,0

373,QUESTION: that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [SEP] ANSWER: <sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like uh misremembering when uh something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged uh i guess in the classical sense of the word,0
373,QUESTION: okay tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently [SEP] ANSWER: um <sigh> i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um um i just recently did a uh uh a project like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so just my thoughts there,0
373,QUESTION: yeah tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make [SEP] ANSWER: <sigh> <laughter> hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh> uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh,0
373,QUESTION: right [SEP] ANSWER: break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory,0
373,QUESTION: what made you decide to do that [SEP] ANSWER: ugh just a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um i uh yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now,0
373,QUESTION: okay how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep [SEP] ANSWER: um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so,0
373,QUESTION: how have you been feeling lately [SEP] ANSWER: um uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little um uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or or company um carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee,0
373,QUESTION: uh huh how do you cope with them [SEP] ANSWER: how do i cope with them um i assume you mean i guess uh people i work with how do i cope with the uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it then uh it's progress right,0
373,QUESTION: yeah have you been diagnosed with depression [SEP] ANSWER: uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that,0
373,QUESTION: mhm how long ago were you diagnosed [SEP] ANSWER: uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist,0
373,QUESTION: what were your symptoms [SEP] ANSWER: uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a a symptom so um uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression,0
373,QUESTION: do you still go to therapy now [SEP] ANSWER: uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh um i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so,0
373,QUESTION: do you feel like therapy is useful [SEP] ANSWER: oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis,0
373,QUESTION: okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory [SEP] ANSWER: um <sigh> i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with uh the man he is,0
373,QUESTION: yeah what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago [SEP] ANSWER: <psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so,0
373,QUESTION: right what would you say are some of your best qualities [SEP] ANSWER: uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh i'm low and uh i treat it as such and i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i i have a i'm a i'm a pretty like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh um i don't i don't lose sight of uh the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so,0
373,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: mm,0

373,QUESTION: that's so good to hear how would your best friend describe you [SEP] ANSWER: um <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have,0

337,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: so i i like i like doing that,1
337,QUESTION: i see what you mean cool when was the last time that happened [SEP] ANSWER: the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so,1
337,QUESTION: wow [SEP] ANSWER: it was kind of an interesting,1
337,QUESTION: what are some things that make you really mad [SEP] ANSWER: uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad,1
337,QUESTION: uh huh okay what do you do when you're annoyed [SEP] ANSWER: when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works,1
337,QUESTION: has that gotten you in trouble [SEP] ANSWER: not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if,1
337,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it,1
337,QUESTION: okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about [SEP] ANSWER: uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my,1
337,QUESTION: whatever comes to your mind [SEP] ANSWER: uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that,1
337,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate,1
337,QUESTION: i see that sounds really hard [SEP] ANSWER: meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on,1
337,QUESTION: yeah who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life [SEP] ANSWER: uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over,1
337,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed,1
337,QUESTION: that's great is there anything you regret [SEP] ANSWER: i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having,1
337,QUESTION: wow [SEP] ANSWER: sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have,1
337,QUESTION: yeah do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself [SEP] ANSWER: oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well,1
337,QUESTION: mhm [SEP] ANSWER: is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it,1
337,QUESTION: yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago [SEP] ANSWER: um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years,1
337,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself,1
337,QUESTION: mhm [SEP] ANSWER: ten years ago <laughter>,1
337,QUESTION: okay have you ever served in the military [SEP] ANSWER: no,1
337,QUESTION: have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d [SEP] ANSWER: no,1
337,QUESTION: have you been diagnosed with depression [SEP] ANSWER: no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge>,1
337,QUESTION: can you give me an example of that [SEP] ANSWER: um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies,1
337,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions,1
337,QUESTION: mhm [SEP] ANSWER: so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two,1
337,QUESTION: how hard is that [SEP] ANSWER: very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that,1
337,QUESTION: yeah [SEP] ANSWER: and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done,1
337,QUESTION: i see how have you been feeling lately [SEP] ANSWER: uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle,1
337,QUESTION: that's good [SEP] ANSWER: and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue,1
337,QUESTION: mhm [SEP] ANSWER: and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it,1

337,QUESTION: uh huh [SEP] ANSWER: and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early,1
